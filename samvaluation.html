                                <p>Ayanami (Retrofit) is a damage-oriented DD with great stats and skills. Her Main Gun damage is really awful, but her Torpedo damage is among the best in the game, especially when combined with her self-buffs. She is ideally equipped with a fast-firing Main Gun to trigger her skill and All-out-Assault barrage faster for maximum uptime. Overall, she is a great ship, but susceptible to the deficiencies of Torpedo targetting on auto-battle.

                                <p>Dido is a damage-oriented CL with great stats and great skills. Her personal damage is amazing when sortied with at least 1 other HMS ship, due to her AoA barrage being very strong and self-buffs. Her Skill 2 can buff Queen Elizabeth or Queen Elizabeth META, but this isn't required for her to be good. With her Augment, she herself can get those buffs and increased Main Gun CRIT Rate, but since her Main Gun damage is not that massive, it isn't necessary for her to be viable. Her Augment also drastically increases her AoA damage. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her Skill 2 flares are practically useless, as they are both RNG and are hard to sync with other ships, despite the effect being very good.

Her personal damage is very high with MGM+1 DD Guns and great barrages (Skill 1 with Augment, Skill 2, and AoA). In particular, her Skill 1 barrage can ignore shields and is triggered individually per Main Gun, making its frequency very fast. You always want to equip her with a fast-firing and high damage DD Gun; never give her a CL gun. In addition, her ASW stat is one of the highest amongst vanguard ships, allowing her to act as a ASW carry. Her AA stat is very high, and when paired with her Skill 1 and very high AA gun efficiency, allows her to act as an AA carry for the fleet. Her bulk is also solid as well, especially with her Augment Module skill. Overall, she is an amazing ship, if a bit expensive to max fully.</p>

Her Skill 1 gives a great debuff, but the activation condition is hard to achieve before the enemy dies, and the duration of the debuff is low too. The barrage that it triggers is good, but nothing amazing as well. The stack based on killing enemies is also hard to achieve, since the other 5 ships in the fleet can easily kill steal from her. Her Skill 2 is basically useless since it debuffs her as the battle goes on. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade / downgrade to other easily-accessible options.</p>

Her bulk is decent due to her shields, and her unique Augment Module further giving her evasion and minor healing. Her Skill 2 doesn't affect her Main Gun choices against enemies. Overall, she is a good ship.</p>

Her Skill 1 gives a vanguard-wide damage buff to enemies hit by her barrage, but the barrage is not guaranteed, and the buff is short. Her Skill 2 increases her damage against DDs specifically by a large amount, but it is not near the top of all CLs despite the buffs. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her personal damage is pretty good against Light Armor enemies and mobbing despite having 1 MGM, due to her summon and her barrage. Her torpedo damage is pretty bad, limiting her potential against Medium and Heavy armor enemies. In addition, she wants to use a Northern Parliament Main Gun due to her Skill 2. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade to more easily accessible options.</p>

Overall, she is a good ship; outclassed by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Independence" title="Independence">Independence (Retrofit)</a>.</p>

Her personal damage is really bad due to low efficiencies, AVI stat, and 6 planes. In addition, she contributes nothing else to the battle outside of her frontloaded damage and healing due to her airstrikes taking almost twice as long as other CVLs. However, her healing is really good, and heals both the Vanguard and Main Fleets. Her Skill 2 barrage does not have enough damage to subvert her deficiencies. Overall, she is an amazing healer, but redundant due to the existance of Unicorn (Retrofit).</p>

                                    <p>Pamiat' Merkuria is a tank-oriented CL with good stats and skills. Her personal damage is decent due to MGM+1 DD guns and a solid barrage. Her bulk is really high, especially when RNG rolls her way. Due to the RNG nature of her bulk, her tanking ability, esepcially when bossing, can be in doubt. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Depending on the equip in her 2nd slot, she can change modes between damage and support. In damage mode, she gains a preload and multiple offensive buffs. In support mode, she grants healing and shield support for the fleet. Overall, she is a great ship regardless of what mode she is in.</p>

Her personal damage is high due to multiple self-buffs, good efficiencies, and a great timed barrage. She can reduce her first Main Gun salvo based on the number of other RN ships in the fleet, but that is not necessary for her to be good. The buff from using AP Guns or having RN ships from her Skill 3 is nice, but not necessary for her to be good. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her shelling damage is really high, and combined with a great barrage makes her personal damage really high. Her self-buffs (especially the Main Gun Spread reduction) are also really good, further boosting her damage. Her crossfleet skill barrage is nice, and the buff is good when using USS CVs in the other fleet. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

Her personal damage is pretty good due to her stats, barrages, and MGM+1, and it is further amplified when in the Off-Tank position. As a Main Tank, she gains damage reduction to further amplify her bulk. In the Middle position, she gives your Vanguard a heal once per battle. As an Off-Tank, she further amplifies the damage your Vanguard Fleet does. Overall, she is a great ship, regardless of which mode she is in.</p>

                                    <p>Katsuragi is a damage-oriented CV with good stats and skills. She has a full 8-plane CV loadout along with good plane efficiencies, making her damage good. Her barrage is very pretty, but each individual petal does a small amount of damage, and the main part of the barrage damage is converging torpedoes, which has an unreliable hit-rate. Her AVI damage reduction support is good, but very situational given that it requires an IJN fleet. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade to more easily accessible options.</p>

Her personal damage is very high due to MGM+1 DD Guns, high torpedo stat and efficiency, and great self-buffs. In addition, she does more damage to burned enemies, and her barrage applies burns, allowing her kit to be maximized without supports. Her bulk is also high due to her Skill 3 self-buffs as well. Her support is nice, but buffing other ships is not needed to make her worth using. Overall, she is an amazing DD.</p>

Her personal damage is very high due to great shelling damage along with her self-buffs. When she is placed off-flag, she fires twice as fast, but deals less damage per volley; overall, this is a slight increase from using her at Flagship, due to more overall damage percent and more barrage procs. Her barrage is nice, but it is not worth to sync the slow it provides with anything. Her buff when equipped with an HE Main Gun is nice, but AP is still preferred against Medium/Heavy armored enemies. Her crossfleet is very nice defense for your other fleets, but is not necessary for her to be good. Overall, she is an amazing BB.</p>

Her barrage can make it better, but it requires winning 2 battles to improve it to a good level. Her self-buffs are also reliant on winning battles throughout the sortie.

                                    <p>Bristol is a damage-oriented DD with good stats and skills. Her personal damage is alright despite 1 MGM, since her barrages are good and she has AoA reduction. Her AA is also good, due to having a relatively high AA stat and efficiencies compared to other DDs. Her lanturn debuff is amazing if it lands, but due to the zone spawing in front of Bristol, it is unreliable to trigger on auto-battle. Overall, she is a good ship.</p>

                                    <p>Kronshtadt is a tank-oriented CB with amazing stats and skills. Her personal damage is high due to MGM+1 CB Guns, as well as multiple skill barrages. She should be equipping a high-caliber Main Gun for faster Skill 1 barrages. She should also be equipping a Northern Parliament equipment to massively increase her secondary gun damage. Her bulk is also very high as well due to her raw stats, as well as minor buffs from her Skill 2 and Skill 3 further augmenting it. Her crossfleet is also nice, but not necessary for her viability. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

                                    <p>Kiev is a damage-oriented DD with good stats and skills. Her personal damage is good, despite only 1 MGM, due to multiple good barrages. The Skill 1 barrage is only buffed on the 2nd and 3rd activations, making her slightly more mobbing-oriented. Her Skill 2 gives her minor self-buffs, but you will realistically never use her as a solo vanguard. Overall, she is a good ship.</p>

She lacks a lot of self-buffs except from her Skill 3, which should be satisfied very easily. Her Skill 2 provides a lot of healing, but two out of the three heals have random targetting. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

                                    <p>Impero is a damage-oriented CV with great stats and skills. Her personal damage is good due to her 8 plane loadout, and a (unfortunately not 100%) timed barrage. Her first skill gives her a reduced reload for her first airstrike when equipping a fighter, allowing her to desync with the rest of your Main Fleet. However, due to her low reload stat relative to other Main Fleet ships, she will eventually catch up after a few airstrikes. Her Dive Bomber mode is not useful due to the damage bonus only applying to 1 airstrike overall, and making her slow reload even slower. Her Skill 2 is effectively useless, as the HP is just being transferred around instead of outright healing. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her torpedo damage is not good, and neither is her barrage damage. Her Skill 1 special burn is not that special, as it does little damage.

                                    <p>Emden is a damage-oriented CL with great stats and skills. She has top CL damage due to her strong barrages and guns, plus an interesting torpedo gimmick. CL gun mode has more damage, but DD gun mode has slightly less damage for solid utility. Either mode works extremely well. Bulk is average, but DD gun mode's heal helps. Overall, she is VERY good. <b>No ghost AA gun, meaning she doesn't drag your fleet down in AA heavy worlds</b>.</p>

                                    <p>Seydlitz is an off-flag damage-oriented BC with great stats and skills. She can off-flag if needed. You want her to have a high % of health as possible, although the damage redistribution goes against that. Main gun salvo reduction is great in mobbing, and she can give other SMS BB/BC the same reduction. Damage output is also fairly solid, making her great in bosses. Overall seems great; nothing exceptional, but she has great damage and the first salvo cooldown reduction.

                                    <p>Vanguard is an off-flag damage-oriented BB with amazing stats and skills. Her AA is very high, allowing her to help the vanguard in plane-heavy areas situationally. Her debuffs are amazing, allowing the entire fleet to take advantage of them. Her personal damage is pretty good with MGM+2 BB Guns, and a good barrage, especially since she can take advantage of her own debuffs. The Secondary Gun Crit Rate buff looks nice on paper but is useless outside W14. Her crossfleet barrage + buff are nice, but not necessary for her to be good. You want to use an HMS equipment on her, which is most likely going to be <a href="https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Twin_40mm_Bofors_STAAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG">Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG</a>, among other great HMS Secondary Gun or AA Gun options.

                                    <p>Indomitable is a damage-oriented CV with great stats and skills. Don't pair her with Prince of Wales or Repulse (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Repulse META" title="Repulse META">Repulse META</a> is fine, but not necessary!), and ideally she is sortied without her fellow Illustrious-class sisters as well. Her 6 fighter 2 torpedo bomber loadout is very nice against light and medium armor targets when equipped with the BF-109G, and has a nice balance of damage and AA with a traditional fighter. Her Skill barrages add more free damage as well. Overall she is a great ship.</p>

                                    <p>Jervis is a mob-tank oriented DD with great stats and skills. Her AoA barrage is good, making her damage output solid even though she only has 1 MGM. Her heal is nice, however it's not enough to support an entire fleet on its own. Her Skill 1 buffs are very situational, with the HMS support being practically useless, and the "only in DD/CL fleet" buff being W14 / W15 specific. Her Skill 2 gives her great bulk when placed in the tank position;however, with her low HP her bulk against bosses is in doubt. She also has 30% Aux stat gain which helps add to her bulk. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her Barrage is very meh, the armor break is alright but not worth sacrificing a BB slot for, and the second skill in its entirety is purely a gimmick. Collection only.</p>

                                    <p>Bellona is a support-oriented CL with good stats and great skills. Bulk is alright, AA is pretty high but not carry level, but her damage output is mediocre. The only redeeming factor about her is the Air Raid Assistance CV buff, combined with her higher than average AA. HMS buff is not worth for the most part due to how situational and bad it is. Overall, she is good as a carrier buffer and for AA support, but not worth using outside this niche.</p>

She is guarenteed max critical damage/rate stacks at 30s into the battle, which is early enough to be relevant especially versus a boss. The sonar part of her skill is useless. The fast load from sortieing with 3 Italians is nice if you can fulfil the requirements, but it is not mandatory for her to be great. Overall, she is a great off-flag BB; typical event SR.</p>

She also has decent bulk from her stats and skills. Due to her damage absorption, she might not tank high-damage output bosses that well; this needs more testing. Overall, she is a very solid tank.

Since Beaver Squadron Tag is wasted on DDs compared to tank cruisers, all aspects requiring it are practically useless. Her damage got buffed from her base form, and she gained a new barrage to further improve it, but it still doesn't make her better than starter retrofits. Overall, she is a good ship.</p>

                                    <p>Musashi is an off-flag capable BB with top tier damage and bulk. She has a guaranteed barrage on main gun fire, a variety of very strong self-buffs, and a crossfleet barrage to boot. She still prefers flagship due to barrage pattern, but can work off-flag. For the IJN Main Gun requirement, the best options are the Twin 410mm Kai (HE, no syncing),  the Triple 460mm (AP, no syncing), or Triple 410mm (AP, syncing). The enhanced barrage is a sizable upgrade, but since Musashi overkills most content in a good fleet regardless, it's fine to ignore it. For the IJN gear requirement, use the Type 1 AP Shell as an Auxilary. Overall, Musashi is amazing, and is highly worth getting.</p>

She also has great bulk, and great potential to increase both her bulk and damage as the battle drags on. Overall, she is solid; nothing spectacular but not awful either.</p>

Ignore the Akizuki-class sortie buff when using her, it is not needed at all for her to be good. Overall, she is solid; one of the best DDs currently.</p>

Overall, she is great as an AA ship, with decent damage to go along with it.</p>

However, her bulk still remains especially frail, which can be a concern on certain stages. Overall, she is a solid option; nothing special, but not bad either.</p>

She has 9 planes, and great stats and efficiencies, making her damage output about equal to the other Rainbow CVs. Due to her barrages, she is best used against Light or Medium armor enemies, but still holds up very well against Heavy overall. Her support is amazing as well, with her AA resistance decrease, and additional USS CV damage buffs on top of it. Crossfleet is always nice to have as well. For the USS plane requirement, there are a lot of great options, check out a gear guide for more information. Amazing CV, highly worth getting.</p>

There is nothing special here, it's just typical CV self-buffs and barrages, making her damage really good. She is ideally used against Light/Medium armor enemies due to her barrages. She even has a survivability bonus. Great CV, highly worth getting.</p>

In addition, MGM+1 coupled with great stats and barrages make her damage really high for a CA. Great CA, highly worth getting.</p>

She has a CV damage buff, flagship protection, and high enough AA to keep CVs hidden most of the time. She even has a special ASW mount to buff her damage there. Bad surface damage drags her down, along with subpar bulk. Great CV buffer.</p>

                                    <p>Yat Sen (Retrofit) is a damage-oriented CL with great stats and skills. She always had enough bulk to main tank most mob content, but now that doesn't require Ning/Ping Hai. Her personal damage is vastly increased due to higher gun efficiencies and FP stat. In addition, she loses reliance on Ning/Ping Hai for her own bulk, although you still need her to buff Ning/Pings bulk in China Wall teams. Retrofit skill fires a decent barrage every 12s as well, which is decent free damage. Great improvement over base Yat Sen, and an above-average CL overall.</p>

Her skills are confusing, but for the most part your fleet is guaranteed max stacks of "No Mercy" every airstrike, giving her great damage output. Her support freezes the enemy, which is amazing for other BBs and CVs alike to land their shots/bombs/torpedoes. The crossfleet is basically negligible for most intentd and purposes though, since the effect is only once per battle. Overall, she is an amazing ship; highly worth getting.</p>

                                    <p>Royal Oak is a off-flag damage-oriented BB with great stats and interesting skills. Her barrage is based upon taking damage or after 20s has passed, both of which allow her to run a shelling gun instead of a barrage gun. Her damage redirection is niche and her self heal is useless for most purposes since backline ships rarely take meaningful damage. She technically prefers flagship but is fine as an off-flag. Overall, typical event SSR. Not horrible but not top tier.</p>

In addition, the heal is very minor compared to using a dedicated healer (like Unicorn). Overall, she is collection only.</p>

Her Skill 2, especially the Release part, gives her a summon that does great, consistent, damage to enemies on the field. Her crossfleet skill is decent, but KMS CVs aren't good enough yet to make a KMS CV fleet worthwhile. Overall, she is an amazing BB; highly worth getting.</p>

In addition, her skill locks on to enemies every 15s, which doesn't sync well with current options. Furthermore, her skills give her more bonuses if there is a locked on enemy alive at the time of activation, which is unreliable outside of bossing. Her barrages are pretty good, but only 1 MGM hurts her damage. Overall, she is a good CL.</p>

She gets torpedo crit rate and self torpedo buffs from her skills, further boosting her damage. In addition, her Skill 3 allows her to spam a torpedo barrage, albeit a weak one.

She gains 15% more main gun efficiency, bringing her gun damage up to par with other SSR BBs. Her barrage proc rate also increases to 100%, although it still suffers the same issues as the original Big Seven (not arcing, not as single-target oriented). The single target barrage is decent, but nothing amazing. Overall, she is a great ship; one of the best easily acquirable BBs for new players.</p>

She also buffs French ships in the same fleet, however there aren't enough French ships currently to make this worthwhile. Overall she is a great CL, especially given that she is free for everyone!</p>

Her Skill 2 heals both herself and the vanguard a good amount, but 5s after an airstrike is fired might be too slow for some fleet compositions. Compared to other healers, having 8 planes is a huge benefit to her own personal damage. Overall she is a great CV.</p>

Her bulk is not good enough to Main Tank hard content, but it is more than enough to Off-Tank or put her in the middle Vanguard position.

Her "Best Buds" support given to other ships is nice but unreliable in its targetting. She is ideally sortied such that her Skill 2 condition for barrage activation chance is satisfied.

Her Skill 1 can be both situationally good or bad, depending on the damage of the stage she is on, so be wary. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade to more easily accessible options.</p>

Her damage is heavily hindered by her equipment options, but is still good despite that, due to MGM+5 and good barrages and self-buffs. In addition, she even has a almost-Preloaded Main Gun, helping clear mob fights faster. Her Tempesta Faction buff is nice, but not necessary to take advantage of for her viability. Her bulk against AVI damage is very bad, due to having 0 base AA stat. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

                                    <p>Guam is a tank-oriented CB with amazing stats and skills. Her personal damage is high due to MGM+1 CB Guns, as well as multiple skill barrages. Her bulk is also very high as well due to her raw stats, as well as her Skill 2 barrier further augmenting it. Her AA capabilities are near the top of the game due to AA+1, as well as her raw AA stat plus her self-buffs. The 15% buff to AA that Guam grants to low AA ships is nice, but not necessary for her to be viable. Her crossfleet is also nice, but not necessary for her viability. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

                                    <p>Laffey II is a damage-oriented DD with amazing stats and skills. Her personal damage is very high; despite only having 1 MGM, she has 2 summons as well as multiple skill barrages to augment her damage further. Her Skill 2 grants her a special AA gun, as well as AA self-buffs, that raise her AA to very high levels when combined with her existing 180% AA mount. You want to equip her with a USS equipment due to her Skill 2. In addition, she can also keep USS CVs hidden more easily due to reducing their detection gauge. Her Skill 3 adds to her bulk significantly. Despite her Skill 1 self barrage starting at 70%, for all procs after the first one it is very easy for it to maintain 100% proc chance. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

Her personal damage is very good due to an effective 100% proc chance barrage when equipped with a USS gear, as well as her self-buffs. Since most trash mobs are very slow, the buff to enemies with lower speed is nice, but trash mobs die quickly anyway so this buff's effectiveness is diminished. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her personal damage is hindered somewhat by 6 planes, but she gets increased slot efficiency and skill barrages to compensate. The ASW strike from her Skill 1 is alright, but very niche since current ASW content is very easy to deal with. Her Skill 2 is nice, but reliant on her taking damage, which as a backline ship is somewhat rare. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade to more easily accessible options.</p>

She is ideally sortied with another Dragon Empery ship to increase her barrage trigger chance to 100%. Her buff to either the Vanguard or Main Fleet is nice, but the Main Fleet buff is significantly more impactful than the Vanguard Fleet buff. Her Skill 2 allows her to ignore the Out-Of-Ammo debuff, making her more effective in a mob fleet compared to a boss fleet. Overall, she is a good ship.</p>

Her personal damage is amazing due to very high self-buffs, very high Main Gun efficiencies, and a barrage that always procs and always lands on its target. Her Skill 1 applies debuffs to enemies hit by her barrage, increasing the damage of the entire fleet. Her Skill 2 grants buffs depending on the Main Fleet composition; both are very good and don't affect her usage at all. Her Skill 3 is defensive oriented, but not relevant in PvE content. Her crossfleet barrage is nice, but since it only triggers once per battle the other fleet cannot take advantage of the support from the barrage relaibly.  Overall, she is an amazing ship; highly worth getting.</p>

                                    <p>Ognevoy is a damage-oriented DD with good stats and great skills. Her self-buffs are great due to all 3 of her skills granting her an FP buff of some sort. Combined with her barrages, and her damage is great. Her Skill 2 triggering multiple times due to sinking enemies is nice, but unreliable due to the 70% proc rate of the original barrage. Her bulk is on the frailer end, so she is ideally sortied in the middle position of the Vanguard Fleet. Her Skill 1 heal is basically equivalent to a Repair Toolkit for the majority of battles, and is unable to solo-sustain a fleet during difficult content. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her bulk is also very good due to her Skill 2 allowing her to evade damage, but her relatively lower bulk stats compared to other tanks makes her overall bulk worse than it seems.

Her barrage is decent, but is unreliable due to requiring her to take damage. Since each Main Gun shell is counted individually, her Skiil 1 support will almost always trigger. Despite this, it is very mediocre due to the slow being a small amount and the damage buffs being for niche ships. Collection only.</p>

                                    <p>Friedrich Carl is a tank-oriented CA with great stats and skills. Her personal damage is high, despite only having 1 MGM, due to possessing a special secondary gun, and having multiple aimed barrages from her Skill 2. She can equip the Triple 283mm CB Gun to bypass shields more effectively, along with her barrages already ignoring shields inherantly. She is ideally sortied in a full vanguard so she can give the off-tank Tuning. The heal from her Skill 1 is negligable, due to how little it will contribute over the course of the battle. Her bulk is also high due to her high HP, EVA self-buffs, and EVA Rate self-buffs. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

She gains increased CRIT Rate / DMG as the battle goes on for longer, which is a solid buff. The slash attack is nice as it ignores shields, and clears bullets / torpedoes in its way. Her Skill 2 debuff is good, but the sonar is not that useful for the majority of content in the game. Furthermore, the debuff does not have a 100% proc rate. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her heal is alright, but nothing special as it's only 8% of her HP once per battle.

Her Skill 2 offers a small heal to all ships in your fleet, which can be nice but is unreliable if used as the only heal in the fleet. The reload buff it gives is a nice minor buff as well. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade to more easily accessible options.</p>

                                <p>Alsace is an off-flag damage-oriented BB with amazing stats and skills. Her personal damage is very high with MGM+2 BB Guns, and an aimed barrage as well. She has a preloaded Main Gun, which helps both when mobbing and bossing to deal with early wave enemies. Her increase to Main Gun capacity is nice for avoiding delays, but overall irrelevant in most content. Her Skill 1 inflicts a nice debuff to enemies, although due to its random targetting its more useful against single-target bosses. Her Skill 2 improves her Skill 1 to last for longer, but the extension isn't as useful since it already syncs with the Main Fleet; sortieing her with FFNF/MNF ships isn't necessary for this condition. Her Skill 3 barrage does no damage, and the heal can only trigger once per battle, making it only useful for the CRIT Rate buffs. Her crossfleet is nice, but not necessary for her viability. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

Her bulk can be suspect due to her Skill 1 lunging her forward, but any form of minor healing is enough to negate this. Her Skill 2 improves her bulk by a decent amount, and also allows her to fire 1 additional Main Gun shot every 3s. Her Skill 3 is also mainly for the additional Main Gun shot every 2s when hitting an enemy afflicted with a DoT. Overall, Mogador is an amazing ship.</p>

                                <p>Béarn META is a damage-oriented CV with great stats and skills. Her Skill 1 gives her a 70% on-strike barrage, with a guaranteed trigger every 2 launches, which is good but not ideal. Her Skill 2 tornado isn't really relevant due to the 3 activation limit per battle, as well as it dealing almost no damage. Her Skill 3 can improve her Skill 1 barrage based on whether a CL gun or Dive Bomber is equipped in slot 3. In addition, her Skill 3 grants her a fast-load, which can be improved even further when equipped with a Dive Bomber. Due to this, equipping a Dive Bomber in slot 3 is generally preferred, due to the improved fast-load, Béarn META having better AVI scaling compared to FP scaling, and the barrage not getting blocked by shields. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her skills orient around her summoning swords (shields), and depending on how many of them remain intact, triggering certain effects. Due to the nature of shields in Azur Lane, chances are the majority of them will get destroyed before the 20s check, causing her Skill 2 barrage to do barely any damage. Due to the timings of the swords and the skill check not lining up, she will only have the swords active for 15s out of a 20s skill rotation. Her bulk is also good, but nothing exceptional, especially without any shields. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade to more easily accessible options.</p>

Her personal damage is great due to MGM+2 BB guns and 2 good barrages (one timed, one on Main Gun salvos). However, both barrages aren't 100% activation chance, and when the Skill 1 "spear" is moving backwards any shield will immediately destroy it. The special burn from her Skill 1 barrage is a nice bit of free damage as well. Her Skill 2 gives her CRIT self-buffs if her Skill 2 barrage hits enemies, which is doable to achieve if it procs. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her personal damage is great despite 1 MGM due to a really good AoA barrage, with her Skill 1 Torpedoes adding on to it. It's recommended to equip a fast-firing Main Gun on her to maximize her barrage damage, such as the Twin 100 Kai or Twin 114; the blue fast guns are also not bad as transitional options. Her Skill 1 can increase her Torpedo Efficiency by 10% when equipped with any KMS weapon, which is easily doable with her Torpedoes. Her Skill 2 increases her damage against Light Armor enemies by a large amount if they are nearby, which is very good when it can activate. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her self-buffs to her torpedo damage boost it from middling to amazing, especially when combined with her high torpedo mount efficiency. Her Skill 2 barrage is good, but only 30% proc rate makes it unreliable. Overall, she is a good ship.</p>

Her barrage has a 100% activation chance, which is very good considering how wide the barrge is. Her barrage can get partially blocked by enemy shields, but that shouldn't be an issue on most stages. Her AP damage taken reduction skill is nice to have, but not necessary for her viability. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her personal damage is also very good, with MGM+1 CB Guns and good barrages. She is ideally equipped with a CB gun to take full advantage of her self-buffs. Overall, she is an amazing ship, but not high priority if you have other UR CBs already.</p>

Her skill changes her Main Guns to do drastically more against Heavy Armored enemies in exchange for being slightly worse against Light Armored enemies, which is a worthwhile tradeoff. She is ideally equipped with a Sakura Empire (IJN) Main Gun for her Skill 1 buff. You do NOT want her to be in the frontmost (tank) position for her skill condition; FS5 removes it anyways.

                                    <p>Mainz is a damage-oriented CL with great stats and skills. Her personal damage is high due to MGM+1 CL Guns, multiple good skill barrages, and her self-buffs. Her bulk is high enough to tank most content in the game, but isn't enough to main-tank in very hard bossing content. Her Fate Simulation removes her positional requirements, which is a very nice bonus to her personal damage when tanking. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her personal damage is very good due to MGM+2 Main Guns, a timed barrage, and her special-secondary gun. Her Skill 1's submarine scan is very niche, and not relevant.

                                    <p>Champagne is an off-flag damage-oriented BB with good stats and skills. Her personal damage is good, despite only 1 MGM, due to her preloaded BB shot as well as drastically reduced Main Gun cooldown. Her barrages are nice, but nothing special. She can be a bit frailer than other BBs due to being Medium armor as well as having damage-redirection from the flagship. Her Main Gun ammo choice should be based on the enemy armor types, not her Skill 2. Overall, she is a good ship, but can be a sidegrade to more easily available options.</p>

                                    <p>Plymouth is a damage-oriented CL with high stats, great bulk, great skills, and an amazing loadout. She has MGM+2 CL guns with two strong barrages, making her a top overall damage vanguard in the entire game. Her skills give your flagship a huge damage boost as well. As one of the highest damage vanguard ships in the game, she is very worth getting.</p>

                                    <p>Brest is an extremely tanky CB with great stats and skills. Her damage output is around the other CBs due to MGM+1 CB Guns, but is still high in the grand scheme of tanks. She has a heal that can support the fleet, but it shouldn't be the only heal used. Her backwards secondary gun is effectively useless for all intents and purposes. Overall, she is an amazing ship, but not high priority if you have other UR CBs already.</p>

                                    <p>Chkalov is a damage-oriented CV with high stats, solid skills, and a solid loadout. Her airstrike barrage is very strong (especially when enhanced), and her debuff barrage, despite the bullets being weak, has a good enough pattern to proc it reliably. Her slow is nice, but the short duration makes it hard to sync with other ships in the same fleet. Lack of a Fighter hurts her in AA areas unless you have an intercept-capable Torpedo Bomber. Overall, she is an amazing CV.</p>

                                    <p>Prinz Rupprecht is a flagship-oriented BC with solid stats and skills. Her barrage is solid, and has a high proc chance. She has a long range ghost gun for more free damage, as well as a great torpedo barrage off of it. She ideally prefers to be flagship due to her barrage pattern. Her heal is irrelevant when paired with a good healer like Unicorn. Overall, she is a great BB/BC option.</p>

Her bulk is a bit on the frailer side, but her smokescreens help mitogate it and offer decent fleet support as well. Overall, she is an amazing CL.</p>

Her special secondary guns are awful for interception, but are better than not having them at all. Her Skill 2 buffs all CV and CVL damage in the fleet outright when paired with a USS Main Fleet ship, which is a very good buff. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

Her damage output is among the best in the game for vanguard ships due to multiple main gun mounts, as well as her shield-ignoring ability from her skills.

Her bulk is great due to her high HP, 30% Auxiliary stat boosts, and her skills. Her damage is not to be scoffed at as well due to multiple barrages. Her Skill 2 drastically adds to her bulk as it gives her +EVA Rate very consistently. She can be equipped with either the Quadruple 152mm or the Twin 150mm TbtsK C42T0 from her self-buffs when given a CL gun. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

                                    <p>Shimanto is a damage-oriented CL with great stats and skills. Her damage is great with MGM+1, double torpedo reloads, and multiple barrages. Her AA is also really good; using her gun to proc her skill can be useful situationally, but is not recommended for general use. Her Skill 1 can be situationally useful, especially when protecting backline ships. Her Skill 2 ghost AA gun is good, and the stacking from the third part of it should happen very fast. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her Skill 1 gives her a timed, 100% chance, priority target barrage, which does a lot of damage. The marking effect from her Skill 1 is nice, but not necessary to play around for her to be good. Her Skill 2 is defensive-focused only, which is not useful for the majority of content. Overall, she is a amazing ship, but can be worse than UR BBs for some content.</p>

                                        <p>Admiral Nakhimov is a damage-oriented CV with amazing stats and skills. Her personal damage is very high with 9 planes, self-buffs to AVI and CRIT Rate, and a great on-strike barrage. Her Skill 1 inflicts a 60% slow on all enemies on field, but it is delayed to 1.5s after her airstrike is launched, meaning that she herself won't be able to benefit from it as much. This can be buffed to stop all enemies on field when paired with another SN ship that can slow, but all SN ships that can slow currently don't have enough personal damage to make them worth using over other options. In addition, she gains a CRIT DMG buff when hitting enemies that are slowed by other SN ships, but timing it can be a hassle. Her Skill 3 gives her good defensive capabilities against being revealed, indirectly increasing her damage. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

                                        <p>Napoli is a tank-oriented CA with amazing stats and skills. Her personal damage is good due to 1 MGM CA Guns, MGM+1 CL Guns, and her special secondary gun. However, all her barrages have very mediocre damage and have slow activation conditions, dragging her damage potential down. Her Skill 1 allows her to ignore shields when an enemy is close by, which is very handy. Her Skill 2 drastically increases her bulk, as while the smokescreen that helps all Vanguard Fleet is nice, the smokescreen that is only for herself lasts longer and buffs her CL Gun damage drastically. It also follows her around, meaning she is in the smokescreen longer. These smokescreens, along with her base stats, allow her to be the tankiest ship in the game, able to tank every single fight. Overall, she is an amazing ship.</p>

                                        <p>Halford is a damage-oriented DD with great stats and skills. Her personal damage is great, despite only 1 MGM, due to her ability to equip the F8F Bearcat (Floatplane), and take advantage of its skill. Her Skill 1 additionally grants her a 15s Seaplane barrage, which both has good damage and has a guaranteed debuff when it lands. Due to how great the F8F Bearcat (Floatplane) is, you want to always be equipping one in Slot 3 over AA guns. Her Skill 2 has self-buffs and an additional barrage when not equipping a Seaplane, but the benefits of the Seaplane (damage, passive interception, screen-clear), outweigh the gains from Skill 2. The benefits from Skill 2 when equipping a Seaplane are nice, but nothing exceptional. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her personal damage is great due to MGM+2 BB Guns, and a guaranteed, priority-target barrage. Her Skill 1 improves this barrage with different effects, both of which are great. The toggle when equipped with an IJN AA Gun is not relevant; there is no need to build around it. Her Skill 2 launches a recon plane which increases Daisen's personal damage to that enemy by a large amount, but it doesn't have priority targetting. When this palne is shot down, she heals the entire Vanguard Fleet by 8% HP, which is enough to solo-sustain a mob-fleet. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her Skill 1 drastically increases her survivability for half her uptime, in addition to firing a great barrage. Her Skill 2 gives her great self-buffs, although the lower HP -> +DMG Dealt buff is unreliable due to how relatively tanky she is. The decrease all enemy ACC debuff is useless due to it's effect and activation condition being awful. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

                                    <p>Helena META is a damage dealer / support-oriented CL with great stats and skills. Her Skill 2 zone is useless due to how unreliable it is to set up, especially on auto-battle. Her Skill 1 allows her to support her entire fleet, however you want to not be equipping an Eagle Union gear to enable 20s timing, as 15s timing is very niche to sync around. Her personal damage and bulk are both pretty good, especially due to her self-buffs and her skill barrages. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Due to her skill, she effectively gets a free salvo compared to the average BB/BC, which is always nice. Shields for the vanguard are always welcome as well. Overall, she seems solid; nothing exceptional but not bad either.</p>

The marking for META/HMS ships is pointless, and so is the random META ship in the fleet dealing more damage. You can sortie her with other META ships to get all her buffs, but that is not necessary for her to be viable. Overall, she is a great BB.</p>

She has great damage with MGM+2 BB Guns, and 2 barrages: one with a high (but not 100%) proc rate that has priority aiming, and one every 12s from her summons. The heal when her summons die is irrelevant, you want them alive as long as possible. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her bulk is very frail, being light armor and having HP drain in her skills.

Her personal damage is very RNG reliant on her barrage, but it is a very very good barrage, especially for a lower rarity BB. Her self-buffs are decent, but only MGM+1 makes her shelling damage weak. Her heal is nice, but not relevant to her viability. Her bulk is also more suspect, due to her being Light Armor and her low HP relative to other BBs. Overall, she is a good ship, but at best she is a sidegrade to more easily accessible options.</p>

                                    <p>Honoka is a flagship-oriented BB with great stats and interesting skills. Her Skill 1 has good self-buffs; although some of the possible barrages are better than others. Her Skill 2 has a nice damage 100% proc rate barrage which does good damage. The healing is unreliable, but it is a nice cushion alongside an actual healer-oriented ship. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Due to her nature of being fast loaded, she is much better in mob fleets when compared to boss fleets. Only 6 total planes hurts her overall damage output, so after her first two launches her worth is reduced. Do NOT run an ASW plane in her slot 3, it is useless. Needs more testing.</p>

                                    <p>Azusa Miura is a tank-oriented CA with great stats and skills. Her bulk is a bit on the lower side for a tank. However, she has MGM+1 CA Guns, great self-buffs, and a skill barrage to make her damage above average for a tank. She is ideally sortied with multiple other Vanguard ships to avoid the negative effect of her Skill 3. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Her personal damage is a bit lackluster due to only 1 MGM and the skill barrage not being enough to make up for it. Her support is also not enough to justify using her over other damage options that can kill the enemy faster. Overall, she is a good ship, but she is a sidegrade / downgrade to easily accessible options.</p>

She has great personal damage with 8 planes and good stats, as well as an on-strike barrage. She also offers additional damage and support on her 1st (preloaded!) and 3rd airstrikes, which are nice to have. The Augment interaction between her and Rikka is not worth using them together for. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

She also has enough bulk to Main Tank most content, however her being Light Armor leaves her a bit suspect to high damage HE bullets. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

                                    <p>Ryza is a damage-oriented mobbing CL with amazing clearing potential within the first 30s of a battle. Her stats are very solid, and coupled with MGM+1 give her good damage output from her Main Guns. Her skills immensely buff the damage potential of all her Auxiliary barrages, and her unique Augment Module adds more barrages to the mix. You want all the Atelier Ryza Bombs equipped on Ryza, due to the +20% crit rate buff to by barrages when equipped by her for applying "Item Mark" to enemies, and for the "Fatal Drive" unique Augment Module barrage. After all her barrages are exhausted, she is painfully average. Amazing CL for mobbing.</p>

                                    <p>Klaudia is a support-oriented CVL with interesting skills. The stats are average for a good CV, so no issues there. Her skills make her act like a healer, especially for Ryza ships. Her skill and augment barrages add to her damage, but compared to other 8-plane damage-oriented CVs, her damage is lacking due to only having 7-planes. Due to her heal being spread out, and having a pseudo preload (from the barrage activation at the start of the battle), and having better per-strike damage, she is an amazing support. Unicorn Retrofit is better than her regardless. Amazing Healer CVL.</p>

In an Atelier fleet, her 2nd skill can activate way more frequently, and her 3rd skill can grant more AP overall to the fleet, thus increasing her contribution by a fair bit. Inside Atelier fleet: Great CV option. Outside Atelier fleet: Meh CV option.</p>

Her barrage is mostly aimed, and has a 100% chance to proc with her augment. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

                                    <p>Homura is a damage-oriented SS with great stats and skills. Her personal damage is very high for an SS due to her stats, efficiencies, and multiple barrages. Her survivability can be an issue due to her Augment-buffed Skill 1, but the damage gains from it are too good to pass up. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>
